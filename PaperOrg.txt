Abstract
1- Introduction
	- Internet Censorhip and Human Rights
	- Motivation of censoring countries
2- Related Work
3- Background
	3.1 Evolution of Censorship Techniques
		- Simplicity, Collateral Damage, Cost and Circumventability
		- paying extreme prices when needed! Internet shutdown! or DDos Attacks (Great Canyon)
		- The Use of DPIs
	3.2 From Centralized to Distributed Censorship 
		- Pros: Better Performance, Lower Cost, Harder to Circumvent
		- Cons: Inconsistent Behavior
	3.3 Stateful Censorship
		- Techniques to desyncrhronize
	3.4 Circumvention Technologies
		- Tor Obfs protocols
		- Fully Encrypted Protocols
4- Mechanics of Realtime Censorship in GFW
	4.1- Mismatching Fingerprints
		- Heuristics For classifying circumvention traffic
		- Prefering lower false positive over false negative
	4.2- Flow Reassembly
		- A full TCP handshake is necessary
		- GFW waits up to 5 minutes for first packet
		- Only the first packet is examined
	4.3- How the GFW Disrupts a Connection
		- UDP is not affected
		- Blocking is port insensitive
		- Not all ASes are Affected Equally
			- Internet Scanning Experiment
	4.4- Residual Censorship
	4.5- Probabilistic Blocking
5- Evading Realtime Censorship
	5.1- Methodology for Detecting Exemption Rules
		- crafted payloads for triggering the censor
		- Use of multiple vatage points
		- Accounting for probabilistic blocking 
	5.2- Discovered rules
		- Entropy Exemption
		- First six bytes are printable
		- Half of the first packet are printable
		- More than 20 contiguous bytes are printable
		- Common Protocols Exemption: HTTP & TLS
	5.3- Evaluating discovered rules
		- Traffic Analysis Experiment
	5.4- Circumvention Strategies
		- Customizable Payload Prefixes
		- Altering Popcount
6- Combining multiple censoring techniques
	- Reduce the load on one tool
	- Have better coverage
	6.1- The Role of Active Prober
7- Other examples
8- Conclusion
	- The need for smart strategy selection
	- Circumvenion should go distributed
9- Summary
